# AERGIA
`Note` after cloning this repo you first need to initialize the git submodules, which you can in laymen terms think of as including the active learning code from a different git repository.

```
git init submodule
git submodule update
```

If you want to get the latest version of the Active Learning code you can always call `git submodule update` later on, but hopefully you can use the code as is.
